# Image Colourization with GANs

By leveraging the power of GANs, it is now possible to create stunning, true-to-life colorizations of old photographs or black / white movies. Whether it's bringing history to life or adding a new dimension to modern visuals, image colourization using GANs and U-Net has many practical applications. This is my GitHub repository showing my GAN model that transforms black and white images into realistic, vibrant colourized versions of the same images.
